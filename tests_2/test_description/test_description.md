# Test Descriptions for Lara Boiler Core

## How to Structure and Describe Test Cases

- Each test case must have a **unique name** in square brackets, e.g. `[user_listing_happy_path]`.
- Add **tags** in square brackets to categorize the test: `[feature]`, `[validation]`, `[permission]`, `[edge-case]`, `[error]`, `[implemented]`, `[not-implemented]`.
- Use the format:
  `- **[unique_name] [tag1] [tag2] ...**: Description of the test scenario.`
- Mark tests as `[implemented]` when done, `[not-implemented]` otherwise.
- Write a **clear, concise description** of the scenario, including expected behavior and context (e.g., permissions, tenant isolation).
- Group tests by feature section (e.g., User Management, Logging, etc.) and by scenario type (happy path, validation, error, edge-case).
- Update this file whenever new tests are added or existing tests are changed.
- Do not duplicate test names; always check for existing cases before adding new ones.

_These descriptions serve as a blueprint for implementing unit and feature/integration tests using Pest. Each test should verify both positive and negative scenarios, with a focus on tenant isolation, RBAC, and logging integrity._
